		Internet Relay Chat v2.1.1
			New generation

I. What the fuck?
=================

irc2.1.1 is the older ircd known, with an old version of IRC protocole,
an installation system deprecated, etc.

But it is really a part of history of the Internet, and I would try to
do an usage version.

II. What changes?
=================

Things I do in this version:

	* Change some things in code to port it to Linux system.
	* Usage of auto-tools instead of an old editable Makefile.
	* Documentation.

III. How to use it?
===================

Just read the INSTALL file.

IV. What is changed between irc2.1.1 and ircu2.10.12 (for example)?
===================================================================

The protocole is really different between the first IRC release (this)
and the latest ircds, like ircu, unrealircd, bahamut, etc.

4.1. Channels
-------------

Now channels are named, and are prefixed by a '#', a '&' or a '+' character.

Before, channels were only numbers, and you can join only one channel with
the /channel command.

To leave a channel, you must use the /channel 0 command.

You can set a topic with the /topic command, and there isn't any mode.

4.2. More
---------

Read the RFC to have more informations.
